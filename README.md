# CargoCalc: Smart Shipping Cost Estimator

## üì¶ Overview

CargoCalc is a modern, responsive web application built with *Next.js* that simplifies the process of estimating shipping costs. It provides users with an intuitive interface to input their shipping details ‚Äî such as origin, destination, and cargo weight ‚Äî and then calculates an estimated shipping cost based on various factors and options. The application also allows users to review their previous estimates, making it a valuable tool for individuals and businesses managing shipping logistics.

## ‚ú® Features

- *Distance Calculation:* Calculates the distance between two locations using a geocoding service (OpenRouteService).
- *Weight-Based Costing:* Integrates cargo weight into the cost calculation, providing realistic estimates.
- *Multiple Shipping Options:* Allows selection of different delivery types (e.g., standard, express).
- *Previous Estimates Tracking:* View a history of past shipping estimates via local storage.
- *Responsive UI:* Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a smooth experience across devices.
- *API Integration:* Uses a backend API route (/api/calcDistance) to fetch distance data.

## Project Structure & My Approach

The project follows a standard Next.js application structure, emphasizing modularity and maintainability.

- src/app/: Contains the core Next.js application routes, including API endpoints (api/calcDistance) and specific pages like estimate and previous-estimates.

- src/components/: Houses custom React components (ShippingEstimator, LocationInput, Navbar, etc.) that are integral to the application's functionality.

- components/ui/: This directory is dedicated to the shadcn/ui components, providing a consistent and accessible UI foundation. I chose shadcn/ui for its unstyled, composable primitives which allowed for significant customization while maintaining high accessibility standards.

- lib/ and src/utils/: These directories contain utility functions for common tasks like cn (for tailwind-merge and clsx), calculateCost.js, and geoCode.js. This separation ensures a clean codebase where logic is decoupled from UI components.

- context/: Manages theme providers, such as ThemeProvider.tsx for only light mode functionality.

### My approach focused on:

- *Component-Driven Development*: Breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components for better organization and reusability.

- *API-First Design*: Implementing a dedicated API route for distance calculation (/api/calcDistance) to encapsulate backend logic and promote clear separation of concerns. This allows for easy integration with different geocoding services and keeps the client-side code clean.

- **Modern UI/UX with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS**: Leveraging these tools to quickly build a visually appealing and responsive interface, prioritizing user experience. The components.json configuration highlights the use of shadcn/ui with custom aliases for streamlined imports.

- *Scalability and Maintainability*: Designing the application with future enhancements in mind, such as integrating more complex cost algorithms or additional shipping options. The clear directory structure and modular code contribute to this goal.

- *Performance Optimization*: Utilizing Next.js features like next/font for optimized font loading and turbopack for faster development builds, as indicated in package.json.
